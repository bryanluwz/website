# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website. It is built using using my brain and fingers, with a good sense of design, humo(u)r, and lots of love (gotta show some love otherwise it won't run).

bUt DiDn'T yOu HaVe OnE aLrEaDy? Silence! I did, but I wanted to start from scratch and build something that is more me (to find a job).
